# Urban Scooters Project: Web App, Mobile App, and API Testing

## Description  
This project involved comprehensive quality assurance testing for three core components: a web application, a mobile application, and an API. The goal was to assess functionality, performance, and usability through systematic testing and to ensure that the system met all requirements and specifications.

I designed and executed test cases for each component, focusing on high-priority features and workflows. The project required effective time management, with a primary focus on web application testing, followed by mobile and API testing. A mix of manual and exploratory testing techniques were used to uncover issues beyond documented requirements.

## Key Focus Areas
- Designing and executing efficient test cases.  
- Identifying and reporting bugs accurately and effectively.  
- Verifying functionality against requirements.  
- Utilizing appropriate tools and methodologies for different types of testing.  

## Key Technologies
- **Git Bash:** For managing version control and project directories.  
- **VS Code:** For scripting and managing test plans.  
- **Postman:** For API testing and request validation.  
- **Android Studio:** For mobile app testing on virtual devices.  
- **Google Sheets:** For documenting and submitting test cases and bug reports.  

## Techniques Used 
- Test Design: Developing comprehensive test cases to ensure coverage of high-priority features.  
- Requirement Analysis: Focusing on requirements to ensure accuracy in functionality testing.  
- Bug Reporting: Logging detailed and actionable bug reports based on findings.  
- Time Management: Allocating time effectively across tasks to maximize productivity.  
- Exploratory Testing: Identifying additional bugs and issues beyond documented requirements (optional but encouraged).  

## Tasks Overview

1. **Web Application Testing:**  
   - Focused on functionality, layout, and key workflows.  
   - Used a structured approach to verify that all required features met specifications.

   - Study the web app requirements. There are images in the requirements, you can also view the page layouts in Figma.
   - Design a sufficient number of positive and negative test cases to validate the fields for the "About Customer” form, which is the first stage of the "Place Order" screen. The test cases should be added to your Google Sheets file.
   - Perform the tests specified in your test cases. The tests should be performed in Google Chrome and Opera (Opera 71 or higher, Chrome 85 or higher, screen resolution: 1280x720). The browser specifications are also listed in the requirements.
   - Record any bugs you find in Jira.

2. **Mobile Application Testing:**  
   - Tested on Android using Android Studio.  
   - Emphasis on functionality, user interface, and navigation.

   - Study the application requirements.
   - Design test cases for the features highlighted and perform these tests. Write cases for the layout and designs for these features. The designs in Figma are here.
   - The test cases should contain the results of the tests and links to the Jira bug reports, if any.

3. **API Testing:**  
   - Verified endpoints using Postman and browser DevTools.  
   - Tested request-response cycles for accuracy and reliability.
