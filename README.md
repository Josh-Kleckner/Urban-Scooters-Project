# Urban Scooters Project: Web App, Mobile App, and API Testing

## Description  
The final project is a culmination of everything I've learned throughout the QA Engineering program. It focuses on testing the functionality and quality of three major components: a web application, a mobile application, and an API. Each task is designed to test different aspects of software quality assurance, emphasizing practical application of skills in test planning, execution, and reporting.

## Key Focus Areas
- Designing and executing efficient test cases.  
- Identifying and reporting bugs accurately and effectively.  
- Verifying functionality against requirements.  
- Utilizing appropriate tools and methodologies for different types of testing.  

## Key Technologies
- **Git Bash:** For managing version control and project directories.  
- **VS Code:** For scripting and managing test plans.  
- **Postman:** For API testing and request validation.  
- **Android Studio:** For mobile app testing on virtual devices.  
- **Google Sheets:** For documenting and submitting test cases and bug reports.  

## Techniques Used 
- Test Design: Developing comprehensive test cases to ensure coverage of high-priority features.  
- Requirement Analysis: Focusing on requirements to ensure accuracy in functionality testing.  
- Bug Reporting: Logging detailed and actionable bug reports based on findings.  
- Time Management: Allocating time effectively across tasks to maximize productivity.  
- Exploratory Testing: Identifying additional bugs and issues beyond documented requirements (optional but encouraged).  

## Tasks Overview

1. **Web Application Testing:**  
   - Focused on functionality, layout, and key workflows.  
   - Used a structured approach to verify that all required features met specifications.  

2. **Mobile Application Testing:**  
   - Tested on Android using Android Studio.  
   - Emphasis on functionality, user interface, and navigation.  

3. **API Testing:**  
   - Verified endpoints using Postman and browser DevTools.  
   - Tested request-response cycles for accuracy and reliability.  

## Conclusion

This project reflects my ability to handle diverse testing tasks, apply critical QA methodologies, and produce quality results under time constraints. It demonstrates my expertise in testing web, mobile, and API systems while adhering to professional standards in test execution and reporting.
